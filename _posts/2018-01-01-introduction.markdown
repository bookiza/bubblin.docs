## Bubblin Superbooks

Bubblin is a world class *open* and *managed* storytelling substrate for writers and artists. It is a community of creative people with a hunch for longform storytelling and publishing.

Note, if you prefer the "decentralized approach" to web and want to be on your own for your book, head over to [Bookiza](http://bookiza.io) to learn more.

### The Bubblin advantage
Publish for the community, make new fans, measure metrics down to last page of your book. Lower the friction for your readers and see the world enjoy your work in real time. Bubblin will distribute and deliver your work automatically to anyone on web and not just those behind iOS or Kindle.

Good thing is that your book will be available to people on those devices too!


> What's the "Superbook" in Bubblin Superbooks?

Superbook basically means `super class` of book. It is an empty container for any kind of longform: books, novels, comics, magazine or anything that needs multi-page storytelling. It's a lot like portable documents or files (example: PDF) but far more consumer friendly.

Superbooks work on all devices, all viewports and all modern browsers on all OSes out there. See [support](https://bubblin.io/support) information to learn more.

### Longform on web

First thing you'll need to be able to publish on Bubblin is a Bubblin Account. Go [sign up](https://bubblin.io/users/new) if you haven't already.

See system [requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-01-requirements %}) needed for publishing.

### Environment
The site [https://bubblin.io](https://bubblin.io) is the `production` environment for all your work. It is where your live book will live.

Bubblin comes with a robust pre-built `RESTful` api, a browser-side `development` environment (code playground) and a locally installable client apparatus [Bookiza](http://bookiza.io) (a `nodejs` based `development` environment and CLI tool) to help writers or developers create, test and publish their best work onto web.

Our FREE and opensource templates make it super easy to work with.
