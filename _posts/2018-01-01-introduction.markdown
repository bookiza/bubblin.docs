## Bubblin Superbooks.

Bubblin is a world class *open* and *managed* storytelling substrate for writers and artists. It is a community of readers around the world on the front but behind the scenes it is a robust production engine to host creativity and stories with Superbook containers.

Note, if you prefer a "decentralized" approach and want to be on your own for your book, head over to [Bookiza](http://bookiza.io) to learn more.

### Bubblin advantage
Publish for the community, make new fans, measure metrics down to last page of your book. Lower the friction for your readers and see the world enjoy your work in real time. Bubblin will take your work automatically to everyone and not just those behind iOS or Kindle. Good thing is that your book will be available to people on those devices too!


> What's the "Superbook" in Bubblin Superbooks?

Superbook is basically a `_superclass` container for all your longform: i.e. books, novels, comics, magazine or anything that needs multi-page storytelling. It's like a multipage document (PDF) but a lot less enterprise-y.

A Superbook works on all devices, all viewports and all modern browsers on all OSes out there. See [support](https://bubblin.io/support) information to learn more.

### Environment(s)
[https://bubblin.io](https://bubblin.io) is the `production` environment for all your work.

It comes with a pre-built RESTful api, a browser-side `development` environment (code playground) and a locally installed client apparatus (a node based `development` environment [Bookiza](http://bookiza.io) and CLI tool) to help you create, test and publish your best on the web.

Our FREE and opensource templates will help make your life as a creative writer/developer easier.
