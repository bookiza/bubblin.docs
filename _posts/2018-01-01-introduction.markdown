Bubblin is a web-based longform storytelling substrate for book writers, comics designers or magazine makers. It's a fully managed Superbook container service that is both *open* and accessible.

### The Bubblin Advantage
Bubblin works harder for your book than anything else on market. Here's how:

Publishing your book directly on web comes with some natural advantages. For example, web takes care of the distribution part automatically and at a very low cost. People can enjoy your work without needing to download an artifact to their disk. This is especially helpful to impulsive readers who don't plan ahead on reading a book as much. And yet your book is also available offline using a [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) under the hood. Similarly SEO is on your side and it's easy for people to share books they like with their friends.

Readers can enjoy the story without being tied down to a specific piece of hardwareâ€”a Superbook usually works everywhere, see [support](https://bubblin.io/support) information for more details. And you get to measure metrics down to the very last page of your book. See the world enjoy your work anywhere, anytime, and on any device they like and not just those behind iOS or Kindle. Good thing is that your book is available to people on those devices too!

### What is a Superbook?

> Superbook basically means **super class of book**.

Superbook is an empty container for any kind of longform: books, novels, comics, magazine or anything that needs multi-page storytelling. Or even a greeting card like [this](https://bubblin.io/book/i-love-you-by-marvin-danig/1). 

Superbooks works like a blog so you can publish, update or unpublish any time you like. 

### Why Superbooks?

Web is generally bad at longform. Handling a large body of text has not only been traditionally difficult (from the beginning of web/time?) but nigh impossible to enjoy as a reader, as compared to say a physical book. It is no wonder that most people (including developers themselves) prefer buying a physical book even for subjects like CSS or JavaScript where the tech moves faster than print could roll out. Apart from issues of inaccessibility of inner pages (or of content deep down a long scroll) and a scourge of propreitary file formats that are generally incompatible with each other, a loose layout and reflow of text makes it hard for book lovers to enjoy longform online the way they do with a physical book: ala, tight packaging and formatting, and a high quality product. A website or an enterprise-y file (like PDF) could never equal the firm experience of a physical book. It wasn't designed that way.

Enter, Superbooks. :-)

Superbooks introduce tradtional book reading experience on web. It uses some of the very same design principles that make physical books so successful. And goes beyond from there. We revisited every accessibility principle out there by picking up best of both the worlds: physical books and web, and smushed it together to build a robust Superbook container that is both scalable and responsive. For example, primary control of a Superbook is page turn.
