Bubblin is a natural longform storytelling substrate for book writers. It's a fully managed Superbook container service that is both *open* and accessible. Read this documentation in form of a [Superbook](https://bubblin.io/book/official-handbook-by-marvin-danig/1).

### The Bubblin advantage
Publish for the community, make new fans, measure metrics down to the last page of your book. Lower the friction for your readers and see the world enjoy your work in real time. Bubblin will distribute and deliver your work automatically to anyone on web and not just those behind iOS or Kindle.

Good thing is that your book will be available to people on those devices too!


> What's the "Superbook" in Bubblin Superbooks?

Superbook basically means *super class of book*. It's an empty container for any kind of longform: books, novels, comics, magazine or anything that needs multi-page storytelling. A lot like a portable document or file (example: PDF) but far more consumer friendly and accessible.

Superbooks work on all devices, all viewports and all OSes and all modern browsers out there. See [support](https://bubblin.io/support) information to learn more.

### Why Superbooks?

Web is generally bad at longform. Handling large body of text has not only been difficult from the beginning of web (time?), but nigh impossible to relish from a reader's point of view. It is no wonder that most developers prefer buying a physical book instead, even for subjects like CSS or JavaScript where tech moves faster than print could roll.

Apart from issues like inaccessibility of inner pages (long scroll) and scourge of multiple propreitary file formats that are generally incompatible with each other, a loose layout and text reflow makes it hard for book makers to achieve what people expect from a book: tight packaging. A website or even a file (like PDF) could never equal the firm experience of a physical book. It was never designed that way.

Therefore, Superbooks. :-)

Superbooks make book reading a *first-class* experience on web. It provides some of the very same design choices that make physical books so successful. And goes beyond from there. We revisited every accessibility principle on web and built a robust Superbook container that scales by picking up best of both the worlds: books and web together. For example, all Superbooks are offline-first, default responsive, pagination is set via pretty urls etc.
