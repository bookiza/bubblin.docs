## Bubblin Superbooks

Bubblin is a world class *open* and *managed* storytelling substrate for writers and artists. It is a community of creative people with a hunch for longform storytelling.

Note, if you prefer the "decentralized approach" to web and want to be on your own for your book, head over to [Bookiza](http://bookiza.io) to learn more.

### The Bubblin advantage
Publish for the community, make new fans, measure metrics down to the last page of your book. Lower the friction for your readers and see the world enjoy your work in real time. Bubblin will distribute and deliver your work automatically to anyone on web and not just those behind iOS or Kindle.

Good thing is that your book will be available to people on those devices too!


> What's the "Superbook" in Bubblin Superbooks?

Superbook basically means `Super Class` of book. It is an empty container for any kind of longform: books, novels, comics, magazine or anything that needs multi-page storytelling. It's a lot like portable documents or files (example: PDF) but far more consumer friendly.

Superbooks work on all devices, all viewports and all modern browsers on all OSes out there. See [support](https://bubblin.io/support) information to learn more.

### Why Superbooks?

Web is generally bad at longform. Handling large body of text on web has not only been difficult from the beginning of web (time?), but nigh impossible from a reader's standpoint. Apart from inaccessibily, poor design and loose reading experience of a scroll, a website or a file (like PDF) can never equal the experience of a physical book. It is no wonder that most developers prefer ordering physical books even for subjects like CSS or JavaScript whereas the tech itself in them almost always moves away faster than print could be out of the door.

Therefore, Superbooks. :-)

Superbooks make book reading a *first-class* experience on web. It utilizes some of the same principles of design and UI/UX that make games performant and successful. We revisit every principle of accessibility from scratch and try to mix best of real books with the best of web, like pagination with pretty urls, offline-first, responsive etc. You can read this documentation in [form](https://bubblin.io/book/official-handbook-by-marvin-danig/1) of a Superbook instead.

### Environment

Bubblin comes with a robust pre-built `RESTful` api, a browser-side `development` environment (code playground) and a locally installable client apparatus [Bookiza](http://bookiza.io) (a `nodejs` based `development` environment and CLI tool) to help writers or developers create, test and publish their best work onto web.

Our FREE and opensource templates make it super easy to work with.
