In this tutorial we'll learn how to write (or code) a Superbook using Bubblin's web-editor.

#### Using the web editor

Bubblin lets you write books online using its in-browser [book playground]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-01-setup %})—a simple code playground—that is powerful enough for short stories, comics, novellas, weekly or biweekly magazines and other miscellaneous items like brochures, greeting cards, restaurant menus etc. Theoretically speaking one could write a full length textbook using the same tool but this is not recommended. For a really long body of work we recommend using [Bookiza Abelone](http://bookiza.io), which is a professional book baking tool for the web.


The following tutorial will focus on using the in-browser book editor, or the book playground:

<!-- #### A simple static book.

Let us begin with the a quick demo. It's fine if you don't understand everything immediately, we will go into all the basics through this article and learn how to create and publish a Superbook. *Superbook* here means *superclass* of books. It is an empty container that holds the pages of your story, which could be anything, a comics book or a magazine or textbook or a greeting card, anything you wish to publish.

Here's a [demo](https://bubblin.io/book/official-handbook-by-marvin-danig/1) of a live Superbook on production.

### Step - 1: Start a new project

To start a new *project*, login into your Bubblin Account and click on the `new` button from the side panel under the Bubblin logo as shown below. Or press '⌘ + M' to open a new _manuscript_ project (See other relevant keyboard [shortcuts]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _pages/shortcuts.markdown %})).

<div class="two-third center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/assets/images/new_project.jpg" width="100%" />
</div>
<br/>
<br/>

### New project
A new project will look something like this: Three large dark colored textareas at the bottom to punch in HTML, CSS and JavaScript for each page of the book. It will also show four empty bluish colored pages (two leafs) that can be navigated using left and right arrow buttons.

</div>
<br/>
<br/>

### Step - 2: HTML structure and Layout

We're going to construct an HTML wrapper for our pages next. Here's a quick [overview]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _pages/structure.markdown %}) on what each page on the book looks like. Do not worry if you haven't written HTML all your life because we're going to use an HTML [template](https://github.com/bookiza/templates) anyway. Copy and paste the following code into the HTML textarea of the editor (bottom left on screenshot shown above) and also inside the `template` dropdown option as show below. Yes, in both the places!:

{% highlight html %}

<div class="leaf flex">
  <div class="inner justify ">
    <h1> Hello world! </h1>
    <p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, <a href="https://wikipedia.com">consectetur</a> adipiscing elite... </p>
  </div>
</div>

{% endhighlight %}


Note, we're using a cool `flexbox` class here that we'll come to shortly. Awesome!, so now we have a heading text saying "Hello world!" and a bit of *lorem ipsum* inside a paragraph tag on the first page, but there is no styling. Try adding a few more words, a little paragraph may be and then we're ready to go to the next step: that is applying styled to make the content look formatted and pretty.

Go to the `template` dropdown menu again and click open the CSS option (see below).

<div class="two-third center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/assets/images/templates.jpg" width="100%">
</div>

Sprinkle the following style rules into the CSS template to apply a `layout` and `typesetting` to the book, and hit `save`.


{% highlight css %}

@import url('//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Serif+Pro|Josefin+Sans');

html, body {
  background: #fff;
  margin: 0 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  color: #444;
  font: 3.6vw/1.2 'Source Serif Pro', serif;
}

h1 {
  margin: 1vw 0;
  padding: 0;
  color: #666;
  font-size: 6vw;
  font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;
  width: 100%;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  margin: 3vw 0;
}

img {
  border: 0;
  -ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;
}

a {
  color: #0077ff;
  outline: 0 none;
  text-decoration: none;
  text-rendering: optimizelegibility;
}

a:focus,
a:active,
a:hover {
  outline: 0 none;
  text-shadow: 0 0 2px #0cf;
}

a:active {
  text-shadow: 0 0 2px #fff;
}

/* Page specific */

.leaf {
  height: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  width: 80%;
  margin: auto;
}

.inner {
  margin: 12% auto;
  width: 100%;
}

.flex {
  display: -webkit-box;
  display: flex !important;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

.justify {
  text-align: justify;
}

/* Custom style below line */
{% endhighlight %}

Wow. Did you notice what just happened?

When we saved the style rules into the CSS template box, all the pages of the book turn white simulatneously. This is a very powerful feature because it lets us apply a uniform layout across the entire book from just one place. At the same time we get to keep the flexibility of customizing individual pages using the `editor`.

How cool is that!?

<br/>
<br/>
<div class="two-third center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/assets/images/laid.jpg" width="100%"/>
</div>
<br/>
<br/>

CSS will format the `content` of your book, add `typography` in there and position the `content` i.e heading with "hello world" and paragraphs near the `mid-axis` of the page. It will also set up a faux margin & padding on either sides of text, both above and below—in a way that your content will always self-organize near the center of the page. Say thank you to `flexbox` for this!

> Stick no more than 2-3 paragraph of text in there and always test/preview your book by clicking the following button:

Do not cram in too much content on just one page, stick to just two mid-sized paragraphs or three small ones at most. Flip over to the next page if the content is about to exceed *visual symmetry* or simply overflow. Continue adding new pages to your book until the story finishes. New pages will automatically use the CSS and HTML template we just applied.

When your book is ready, hit `publish` and serve it hot.

That's it: in just two bold steps your book is now available to anyone on the planet, from Australia to the ISS.
