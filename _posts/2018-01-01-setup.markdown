First thing you'll need to be able to publish is a Bubblin Account. Go [sign up](https://bubblin.io/users/new) now if you haven't already with a valid email address.

There are two separate ways to get your book/project up and running:

#### 1. Quick Editor (web)

Bubblin has an in-built web based manuscript editor, a simple code playground, that let's you write and format your story using standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The editor works best on the desktop browser.

Here's a super quick [tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-01-tutorial %}) on how to write a Superbook using web editor and layout templates.

No further setup is required.


#### 2. Bookiza Abelone

A more powerful way to create and publish Superbooks on Bubblin (or on your own website) is with [Bookiza][bookiza].

Bookiza is an open source book reification tool or a "book development framework" written and maintained by the Bubblin team. To set it up, following minimum system [requirements]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _pages/requirements.markdown %}) must be met.

Assuming there is `nodejs` and a `terminal` app on your machine, complete the following steps:

```node
$ npm i -g bookiza

$ bookiza --version

$ bookiza register

```
