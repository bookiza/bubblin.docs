First thing you'll need to be able to publish is a Bubblin Account. Go [sign up](https://bubblin.io/users/new) now if you haven't already with a valid email address.

There are two separate ways to get your book/project up and running:

#### 1. Quick Editor (web)

Bubblin has an in-built web based manuscript editor, a simple code playground, that let's you write and format your story using standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The editor works best on the desktop browser.

Here's a super [quick tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-01-tutorial %}) on how to write a Superbook using the web editor with Superbook *templates*.

No further setup is required.




#### 2. Bookiza Abelone (nodejs/terminal)

Another way to write and publish a book on Bubblin (or on your own website) is by using [Bookiza][bookiza]. See other system [requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-01-requirements %}) needed for Superbook publishing.
