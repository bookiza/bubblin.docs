First thing you'll need to be able to publish on Bubblin is a Bubblin Account. Go [sign up](https://bubblin.io/users/new) if you haven't done that already.

There are two separate ways to get your book/project up and running:

#### 1. Quick Editor (web)

Bubblin has an in-built web based manuscript editor, a simple code playground, that let's you write and format your story using standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The editor works best on the desktop browser.

Here's a super quick [tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-01-tutorial %}) on how to write a Superbook using web editor and layout templates.

No further setup is required.


#### 2. Bookiza Abelone

A more powerful and professional way to create and publish Superbooks on Bubblin (or on your own website) is with [Bookiza][bookiza] -- the book reification tool.

Bookiza is an open source "book development framework" written and maintained by the Bubblin team and a bunch of [contributors](). To set it up, following minimum system [requirements]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _pages/requirements.markdown %}) must be met.

Assuming that there is `nodejs` and a `terminal` on your machine, with following steps you'll be up and running in under a minute:

To install:
```node
$ npm i -g bookiza
```

Check installation with:

```node
$ bookiza --version
```

Next, register client with:

```node
$ bookiza register
```

It will ask for your Bubblin Account credentials and connect Bookiza to its sweet POST/PATCH API. You're all set â€¦ ðŸ˜‡

To start a new project `My-Awesome-New-Comics`:

```node
$ bookiza new My-Awesome-New-Comics --leafs 12 --template comics
```
Will create a new project with 12 fresh leafs (24 pages) inside manuscript/ folder along with a layout template meant for comics. Boom!

Refer Bookiza [documentation][bookiza] for more help on this.
