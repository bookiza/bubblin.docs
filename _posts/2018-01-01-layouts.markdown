It is super easy to apply a layout on your Superbook. Use the layout `template` feature to apply styles across the entire book. 

There's also an option to pick a template for HTML, JavaScript & HEAD components of your Superbook.

Use the dropdown for templates as shown below:

<br/>

On a Bookiza project, layout can be added via the `templates` folder inside the project. Bookiza will automatically pick and apply style to your book.

Check out some free and open source [templates](https://github.com/bookiza/templates) on Github to get started.

### Strong layouts:

Bubblin uses a concept called *strong layouts* for books. It's neither a fixed layout that restricts scalability nor a fluid one that allows reflow beyond control. The Superbook container will automatically scale and set the outer periphery of the `<page>` i.e. iframe. It will also handle the height/width proportion using `dual` or `single` view for your book automatically depending on portrait or landscape mode of the user device. It does so by optimizing for "maximum real estate". The innards of the iframe is where your own content and style will live.

Typically, you'd want to set the height and width of `body`, `html` elements to `100vh` and `100vw` respectively, like so:

{% highlight css %}

@import url('//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Serif+Pro');

html, body {
  background: #fff;
  margin: 0 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  color: #444;
  font: 4vw/1.2 'Source Serif Pro', serif;
}

// Other style classes below as necessary.

{% endhighlight %}

Notice that the `font-size` is also set using `viewport units` to allow **strong** content scaling unlike seen anywhere else.

> Rule #1: Never use a CSS framework on your book! See [best practices]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-01-practices %}) for a great layout.
