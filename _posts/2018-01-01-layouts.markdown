It's very easy to apply a layout to a Superbook.

Use the templates feature to add a layout (style) that works across the book. Occassionally, you may also need a template for HTML, JavaScript & HEAD be applied into your book as well. For any of that, use the dropdown option for templates as shown below:

<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/assets/images/templates.jpg" width="100%" />
<br/>
<br/>

On a Bookiza project, layout can be added via the `templates` folder inside the project. Bookiza will automatically pick and apply style to your book.

Check out some free and open source [templates](https://github.com/bookiza/templates) on Github to get started.

### How it works:

Bubblin uses a concept called *strong layouts* for books. It's neither a fixed layout that restricts scalability nor a fluid one that allows reflow beyond control. The Superbook container will automatically scale and set the outer periphery of the `<page>` i.e. iframe. It will also handle the height/width proportion using `dual` or `single` view for your book automatically depending on portrait or landscape mode on user device for "maximum real estate".

The innards of iframe is where your own content and style will live.

Typically, you'd want to set the height and width of `body`, `html` elements to `100vh` and `100vw` respectively, like so:

{% highlight css %}

@import url('//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Serif+Pro');

html, body {
  background: #fff;
  margin: 0 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  color: #444;
  font: 4vw/1.2 'Source Serif Pro', serif;
}

// Other style classes below as necessary.

{% endhighlight %}

Notice that the `font-size` is set using `viewport units` to allow **strong** content scaling unlike anywhere else.

> Rule #1: Never use a CSS framework on your book! See [best practices]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-01-practices %}) for a great layout.
