It's very easy to apply a layout to a Superbook.

Use the templates feature to add a layout (style) that works across the book. Occassionally, you may also need a template for HTML, JavaScript & HEAD be applied into your book as well. For any of that, use the dropdown option for templates as shown below:

<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/Official-Handbook/master/assets/images/templates.jpg" width="100%" />
<br/>
<br/>

On a Bookiza project, layout can be added via the `templates` folder inside the project. Bookiza will automatically pick and apply style to your book.

Check out some free and open source [templates](https://github.com/bookiza/templates) on Github to get started.

### How it works:

The Superbook container will automatically scale and set the outer periphery of a `<page>` i.e. iframe. It will handle the height/width proportion and `dual` or `single` view of your book automatically depending on portrait or landscape mode on user device.

The internals of the iframe is where your content and style will live.

Typically, you'd want to set height and width of `body`, `html` elements to `100vh` and `100vw` respectively, like so:

{% highlight css %}

@import url('//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Serif+Pro');

html, body {
  background: #fff;
  margin: 0 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  color: #444;
  font: 4vw/1.2 'Source Serif Pro', serif;
}

// Other style classes below as necessary.

{% endhighlight %}

Notice that the `font-size` is set using `viewport units` to allow **strong** content scaling unlike anywhere else.

> Rule #1: Never use a CSS framework on your book! See [best practices]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-01-practices %}) for a great layout.
