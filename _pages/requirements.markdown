First thing you'll need to be able to publish on Bubblin is a Bubblin Account. Go [sign up](https://bubblin.io/users/new) if you haven't already.

Alternatively, if you intend to use [Bookiza](http://bookiza.io) to write your book locally, you'll need:

`nodejs` (v8.11.3) or higher, `gulp`, `shelljs`, `git-scm` and a unixy-style shell or the `terminal` app.


## Machine
A desktop with following minimum configuration:

### Memory
Minimum 2Gb RAM. Recommended 4Gb.

### Browser
Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari or MS Edge. Having older versions of IE is recommended as well for testing.

### Operating System: 

Any!

1. MacOS
2. Linux 
3. Windows

Users on Windows need to install a unixy-style shell interface like [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-windows-powershell?view=powershell-6), [Babun](http://babun.github.io/), [Cmnder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder) or [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). Mac & linux users have what is called the terminal app or the bash or the shell, or they could use iTerm or Hyper as well.
